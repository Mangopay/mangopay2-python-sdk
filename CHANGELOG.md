[List Disputes for a User](https://docs.mangopay.com/endpoints/v2.01/disputes#e817_list-a-users-disputes)

[List Disputes for a Wallet](https://docs.mangopay.com/endpoints/v2.01/disputes#e816_list-a-wallets-disputes)

[List all Disputes](https://docs.mangopay.com/endpoints/v2.01/disputes#e241_list-all-disputes)

## [3.25.0] - 2023-01-12

Verifying some specific legal structures is now more efficient thanks to a new legal entity type: `PARTNERSHIP`.

The Legal User LegalPersonType parameter now includes the `PARTNERSHIP` value. The following endpoints have been updated accordingly:

[Create a Legal User (Owner)](https://docs.mangopay.com/endpoints/v2.01/users#e1060_create-a-legal-user-owner)

[Update a Legal User](https://docs.mangopay.com/endpoints/v2.01/users#e261_update-a-legal-user)

Please note that changing the LegalPersonType to `PARTNERSHIP` for an existing user will automatically result in:

- A KYC downgrade to Light (default) verification
- The REGISTRATION_PROOF document being flagged as OUT_OF_DATE.

<a href="https://docs.mangopay.com/endpoints/v2.01/regulatory#e1061_the-country-authorizations-object">View a country's authorizations</a> <br>
<a href="https://docs.mangopay.com/endpoints/v2.01/regulatory#e1061_the-country-authorizations-object">View all countries' authorizations</a>

With these calls, it is possible to check which countries have:

- Blocked user creation
- Blocked bank account creation

Please refer to the <a href="https://docs.mangopay.com/guide/restrictions-by-country">Restrictions by country</a>
article for more information.

## [3.22.0] - 2022-06-29
## Added
**Recurring: €0 deadlines for CIT**

Setting free recurring payment deadlines is now possible for CIT (customer-initiated transactions) with the **FreeCycles** parameter.

The **FreeCycles** parameter allows platforms to define the number of consecutive deadlines that will be free. The following endpoints have been updated to take into account this new parameter:

<a href="https://docs.mangopay.com/endpoints/v2.01/payins#e1051_create-a-recurring-payin-registration">Create a Recurring PayIn Registration</a><br>
<a href="https://docs.mangopay.com/endpoints/v2.01/payins#e1056_view-a-recurring-payin-registration">View a Recurring PayIn Registration</a><br>

This feature provides new automation capabilities for platforms with offers such as “Get the first month free” or “free trial” subscriptions.

Please refer to the <a href="https://docs.mangopay.com/guide/recurring-payments-introduction">Recurring payments overview</a> documentation for more information.

## 3.21.0 - 2022.05.24
### Added 

#### UserCategory management

Users can now be differentiated depending on their MANGOPAY usage.

This is possible with the new UserCategory parameter, whose value can be set to:

- Payer – For users who are only using MANGOPAY to give money to other users (i.e., only pay).
- Owner – For users who are using MANGOPAY to receive funds (and who are therefore required to accept MANGOPAY’s terms and conditions).

Please note that the following parameters become required as soon as the UserCategory is set to “Owner”: 
- HeadquartersAddress
- CompanyNumber (if the LegalPersonType is “Business”)
- TermsAndConditionsAccepted.

The documentation of user-related endpoints has been updated and reorganised to take into account the new parameter:

[Create a Natural User (Payer)](https://docs.mangopay.com/endpoints/v2.01/users#e255_create-a-natural-user)
[Create a Natural User (Owner)](https://docs.mangopay.com/endpoints/v2.01/users#e1059_create-natural-user-owner)
[Update a Natural User](https://docs.mangopay.com/endpoints/v2.01/users#e260_update-a-natural-user)
[Create a Legal User (Payer)](https://docs.mangopay.com/endpoints/v2.01/users#e259_create-a-legal-user)
[Create a Legal User (Owner)](https://docs.mangopay.com/endpoints/v2.01/users#e1060_create-a-legal-user-owner)
[Update a Legal User](https://docs.mangopay.com/endpoints/v2.01/users#e261_update-a-legal-user)
[View a User](https://docs.mangopay.com/endpoints/v2.01/users#e256_view-a-user)
[List all Users](https://docs.mangopay.com/endpoints/v2.01/users#e257_list-all-users)

Differentiating the platform users results in a smoother user experience for “Payers” as they will have less declarative data to provide.


## 3.20.0 - 2022.05.12
### Added

#### Terms and conditions acceptance parameter

The acceptance of the MANGOPAY terms and conditions by the end user can now be registered via the SDK.

This information can be managed by using the new `TermsAndConditionsAccepted` parameter added to the `User` object.

The following API endpoints have been updated to take into account the new TermsAndConditionsAccepted parameter:

[Create a Natural User](https://docs.mangopay.com/endpoints/v2.01/users#e255_create-a-natural-user)
[Update a Natural User](https://docs.mangopay.com/endpoints/v2.01/users#e260_update-a-natural-user)
[Create a Legal User](https://docs.mangopay.com/endpoints/v2.01/users#e259_create-a-legal-user)
[Update a Legal User](https://docs.mangopay.com/endpoints/v2.01/users#e261_update-a-legal-user)
[View a User](https://docs.mangopay.com/endpoints/v2.01/users#e256_view-a-user)

Please note that:

- Existing users have to be updated to include the terms and conditions acceptance information.
- Once accepted, the terms and conditions cannot be revoked.

### Added

#### Instant payment eligibility check

With the function
`PayOutEligibility(params).check_eligibility()`
the destination bank reachability can now be verified prior to making an instant payout. This results in a better user experience, as this preliminary check will allow the platform to propose the instant payout option only to end users whose bank is eligible.

## 3.12.0 - 2021.06.10
## Added

- [Initiate your recurring payment flow](https://docs.mangopay.com/endpoints/v2.01/payins#e1053_create-a-recurring-payin-cit) with an authenticated transaction (CIT) using the Card Recurring PayIn endpoint
- [Continue your recurring payment flow](https://docs.mangopay.com/endpoints/v2.01/payins#e1054_create-a-recurring-payin-mit) with an non-authenticated transaction (MIT) using the Card Recurring PayIn endpoint

This feature is not yet available in production and you need to contact the Support team to request access.

## 3.11.0 - 2021.05.27
## Added 

Mangopay introduces the instant payment mode. It allows payouts (transfer from wallet to user bank account) to be processed within 25 seconds, rather than the 48 hours for a standard payout.

You can now use this new type of payout with the Python SDK.

Example :

```python
get_bank_wire = BankWirePayOut.get_bankwire(payout_id)
# where payout_id is the id of an existing payout
```

Please note that this feature must be authorized and activated by MANGOPAY. More information [here](https://docs.mangopay.com/guide/instant-payment-payout).

## Fixed

More information about how to test payments, click [here](https://docs.mangopay.com/guide/testing-payments).

### Others

- httplib2 has been updated to the last version
- RemainingFunds was flag wrongly as mandatory for PreAuthorization. It has been fixed.
- ProcessedDate had the type IntegerField instead of DateTimeField. It has been fixed.

## Added 

### New events for PreAuthorization

Some of you use a lot the [PreAuthorization](https://docs.mangopay.com/endpoints/v2.01/preauthorizations#e183_the-preauthorization-object) feature of our API. To make your life easier, we have added three new events :

- PREAUTHORIZATION_CREATED
- PREAUTHORIZATION_SUCCEEDED
- PREAUTHORIZATION_FAILED

The goal is to help you monitor a PreAuthorization with a [webhook](https://docs.mangopay.com/endpoints/v2.01/hooks#e246_the-hook-object).

*Example: If a PreAuthorization is desynchronized, when the status is updated, you will be able to know it.*

### Logging

We have merged @rbarrois pull request. The logging module expects user to provide the string as a first argument, and all interpolation parameters in separate positional or keyword arguments: `logger.debug("trying x=%s", x)`.

This brings two benefits:

- The interpolation is only performed if the logging message is actually
used (debug messages won't even be interpolated if logging is set to
WARNING)

- Monitoring libraries like Sentry can group messages based on their
non-interpolated message, which helps detecting similar issues.


## 3.10.0
## Added

### On demand feature for 3DSv2

> **This on-demand feature is for testing purposes only and will not be available in production**

If nothing is sent, the flow will be 3DS V1. 

The `Requested3DSVersion` may be included on all calls to the following endpoints:
* `/preauthorizations/card/direct`
* `/payins/card/direct`

#### Response

In the API response, the `Requested3DSVersion` will show the value you requested:
* `V1`
* `V2_1`

The parameter `Applied3DSVersion` shows you the version of the 3DS protocol used. Two values are possible:
